Hey there. You don't know what **Markdown** is? It's a couple of things, let's dive into them! You have to know that because if you don't know that, you are an _idiot_. Very very big idiot. And that's the full reason.

Are you motivated? You [should be](https://www.pabloescobar.cz/). Because now you know what will you be if you won't listen to me carefully. This is short sentence.

## Let's start
Here I am going to write much, much longer sentence. It will be about your nose and bed and why is that bed so cool. You know. I'm not living here because I live on another planet. That you didn't know that? You're such a liar. Go and fire yourself.

    $ hugo --gc --minify

Protože nevím, co udělá příkaz `hugo --gc`, tak ho radši ~~ne~~budu používat. Mohlo by to dopadnout blbě. A to samozřejmě v žádném případě nechci.

## Dive in even more
Hey, it's pretty simple to tame an owl. You need just a little ball and a big melon. Then, put it in front of the owl you want to tame and wait.

Owls are very, very problematic animals. They don't know what time really is, but every time you ask them to answer current time, they answer right. It's very obvious, but don't think about it.

### Now, little heading please
Thank you so much. I want to tell you something little: the heading above this text is very, very little. Don't try to make it bigger, you can't do it.

### And another one, I am lazy
And because I am lazy, I will write another bigger sentence for you. This will be about my hands, brain, eyes and the whole body, which is very tired. I wasn't sleep for about three days. That's very unusual, right?

## And back to the bigger ones
This will be the latest. I hope you've enjoyed this blog post because it was very hard to write. Have a nice day!
